    <br>
    <p class="textAlign"> I have been interested in coding and programming for over 10 years. I initially wanted to become a Computer Science major in college, but I was told that Business was the way to go and the wave of the future. I ended up graduating with a degree in Marketing which led me to a rewarding career with many promotions, laughs, and fun along the way; however I always felt like something was missing. After a lot of thinking I made a hard decision and decided to leave my career and enroll in the 6 month intensive Boot Camp offered at the UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN EXTENSION â€“ CODING BOOTCAMP. During the program we learned critical front end and back end skills necessary to make websites work. The most exciting part of the camp is that we created lots of games and applications, which made us very well prepared for positions in design and development.
